                <p>Hi, I’m Balaji, a passionate frontend developer eager to bring ideas to life through clean, responsive, and dynamic web interfaces. I’ve recently completed my training in frontend development and gained hands-on <span>experience through an internship</span>.

                    As a <span>fresher</span>, I’m excited to step into the tech industry, collaborate with innovative teams, and contribute to building user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I’m a quick learner, enthusiastic about solving challenges, and always ready to adapt to new technologies.

                    Hobbies: When I’m not coding, I enjoy drawing, playing games, and exploring new things to fuel my creativity and stay inspired.
